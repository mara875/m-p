<p> On July 31st, we're getting married in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, at 16:00 (San Luis Potosí) / 23:00 (Berlin).

Due to the pandemic we won't be able to see you in person but we'd be the happiest if you can be with us when we confirm our civil wedding at our favourite church in San Luis.

HOW?
You can watch us say yes via clicking the "live stream" button below.

Additionally, if you want to, you can also join a Zoom call with everyone else who's watching via clicking "Zoom call with everyone".

PRESENTS?
Unfortunately, we won't be able to hand you a physical present but we will think of a way to thank you for joining us on our special day.

If regardless you feel like you would like to support our common future, we are happy about every cent you can spare to get another step closer towards establishing our lifes in both Germany and Mexico. More precisely: The cents will be the building blocks for our casita, our house, in Mexico.

Apart from that, half of your contributions will be donated to a migrants' home here in San Luis. It's best I'd they speak for themselves which is why can find more info when you click on the "donate" button.

Lastly, we would like to thank you for raising us, for accompanying us until this special day, for your friendship, for being there for us.

Thank you, muchas gracias & vielen Dank!
Mara & Peter	</p>
