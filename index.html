<p> We are getting married and we would love you join us in a live-stream on 31.07.21 4PM(Mexico City Time)/ 11PM (Berlin Time).

	<br>The link will be available on due time here.

	<br>If despite the party-postponement you'd still like to give us a gift, we would love to receive any possible contribution at the account xxxx.
	<br>Migration will always accompany our family, that is why we will be donating half of your contributions to Casa Migrante San Luis Potosi.
	<br>Lastly, we would like to thank you for raising us, for accompanying us until this special day, for your friendship, for being there for us.

Thank you, muchas gracias & vielen Dank!
